-- our browser understands only html , css , and javascript
-- react is not a part of our browser
-- to work with react we have to inject CDN links into our code
--  WHAT ARE CDN LINKS ?
-- there are two cdn links 1-"react.development.js" and 2-"react-dom.development.js"
-- react not only work for browser but also work for mobile development as react-native

-- React.createElement is an object
-- the render method actually converts this object into the html element

-- const heading = React.createElement("h1" , {} , "hello world from react");
        -here {} , is used for adding attributes to our html tag (attribute_name : " " )
        - for ex: {id : "heading"}

-- order of cdn links matters.
        - first our cdn links script
        - then our app.js script

-- library and framework
        - react can work for a little piece of our code
        - react can work on our existing project with other framework
