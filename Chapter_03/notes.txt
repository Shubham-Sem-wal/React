⏺️ JSX - jsx is not a part of react
        - it is not html inside javascript
        - jsx is html like syntax or we can say "it is syntax extension of javascript".

⏺️ note - In core react
                const heading = React.createElement("h1" , {id:"heading"} , "hello react");

            In JSX 
                const heading = <h1 id="heading"> hello react </h1>;

⏺️ note - JS engine understands only pure javascript which is defined by ecma script
         - JSX code is transpiled into javascript code before it reaches to the broweser and
                this is done by bundler (bable do it for bundler)
        
⏺️ Bable - is a javascript compiler it transpiled JSX code into actual javascript code
          - bable is not created by facebook
          
⏺️ React component - There are two type of react component
                    -functional component
                    -class based component

                    fucntional component - functional component is nothing but normal javascript function 
                                            which returns some piece of JSX.

                    - component composition : using component inside component
